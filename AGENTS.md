## Work Log Rule

- Every work session must update `WORKLOG.md` with a short summary.
- Add a new entry (or append to the current date section) describing:
  - what was changed
  - key decisions or constraints
  - remaining issues / next steps (if any)
- Update the work log before finishing the response for the task.
